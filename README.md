Recycle Ithaca's Bicycles Participant Policies:

	Please Sign In- 
	
	If it's your first time here, also fill out a participation form.
	Hands Off Approach- 
	
	RIBs values learning, education, and empowerment.  We don't fix things for you, rather we help you do it yourself.
	Ask for Help- 
	
	If you don't know how to use a tool or part please ask.
	
	Open Shop & Used Parts are available to everyone for free, but your donations are very important. RIBs relies on the practice of mutual aid.  This means that we are able to be here when you need us because of your donations and volunteer time.
	Bicycles for Sale 
	
	have been inspected and repaired by RIBs staff.  They are guaranteed against defects for 30 days.
	Build a Bike Program- 
	
	Bikes not for sale or otherwise allocated can be repaired or rebuilt, or just plain built from parts freely available on site. Once the bike meets our safety standards, you may then own the bicycle if you wish (and even ride it home ^_^ ).
	RIBs is Elite But Not Elitist- 
	
	We hold that a bicycle should be judged by its safety, its functionality, its beauty, its historical value, and its utility. RIBs upholds the bicycle as an object of art and purpose regardless of the price tag, the pedigree, the popularity, or current fashion trends.
	RIBs is a Safer Space- 
	
	This means that we don't tolerate language or behavior that is sexist, racist, homophobic, trans phobic, abusive, condescending, or violent. Ask before touching anyone else's project, certainly ask before touching anyone themselves, and try your best to listen as much as you speak.

		By signing here, I acknowledge that I have read all of RIBs policies, and will abide by additional policies as set by RIBs staff.  Furthermore, I realize that working with tools and riding bikes have inherent risks, and that neither Recycle Ithaca's Bicycles, RIBs staff, nor the Southside Community Center are responsible for any injuries occurring while working at RIBs, or because of services received therein.
